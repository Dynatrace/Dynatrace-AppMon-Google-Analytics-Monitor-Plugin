The Google Analytics Monitor plugin enables querying values from any website monitored with Google Analytics.The plugin retrieves values such as PageViews, Vistors, New Visitors, Bounces, Exits, Time on Page and Time on Site. This plugin allows you to view and correlate these values with application or infrastructure measures collected by dynaTrace.  
Correlating these values allows you to answer questions like: Is the Bounce Rate going up because I have a problem on my landing pages? Do my PageViews go down because of slow performance transactions?
